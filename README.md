# Time-Series

Course taught by Prof. Pr Julien Jacques for S21 Cohort


Course summary: first forecasting model will be studied, exponential smoothing, which aims to modelize the deterministic part of the series. The ARIMA models will allow to go further by modelizing also the stochastic components of the series. Finally, some more advanced models will be studied: neural networks, dynamic regression models and models for grouped time series.

Course Objectives: To be able to forecast the future of one or several times series
